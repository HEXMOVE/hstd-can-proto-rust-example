# hstd-can-proto-rust-example

This is a simple example of how to use the `hstd-can-proto` with rust. 

This example will connect to `DEFAULT_ADDR` and try to get major info about the device, and print the can messages out.

Remember to recursively clone the submodules, then just run `cargo run` to have fun :)
